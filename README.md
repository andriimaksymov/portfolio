## Content Updates

Most portfolio content lives in:

```text
src/data/portfolio.ts
```

Use that file for profile details, social links, experience timeline data, skill groups, project descriptions, impact bullets, value cards, and certificates.

The downloadable CV lives at:

```text
public/Andrii-Maksymov-CV.pdf
```

To update the CV, replace that file while keeping the same filename, or update the `href` in `src/App.tsx`.

## Design And Accessibility

- Responsive single-page portfolio layout
- Semantic sections and accessible links/buttons
- Keyboard-visible focus states
- Reduced-motion handling for users who prefer less animation
- Reusable components for cards, buttons, section wrappers, skills, projects, and timeline content
